This React Native bug arises when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue is that when retrieving data, the retrieved value is unexpectedly null, even though the data has been successfully stored.  This happens inconsistently; sometimes the data is retrieved correctly, other times it's null. The code below demonstrates the problem.  The `storeData` function works as expected, but `retrieveData` often returns null despite seemingly correct usage.
